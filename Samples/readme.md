# Samples for Testing

Try opening solution with Visual Studio. If some projects cannot be opened You need 
Project Flaves VSIX Package extension for Visual Studio.

Project Flaves VSIX Package extension for Visual Studio enables opening, but not always
building of the projects. The main purpose is to be able to edit project structure (add
project links and source links) thus enabling cross platform development in Visual Studio.

Some projects like Xamarin.iOS (MonoTouch) can be opened in Visual Studio if user owns
Business Licence of Xamarin.iOS.
